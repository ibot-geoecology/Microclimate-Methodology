# 4. Working with Rasters

Currently, many climatic data are available in raster form, from global to purely local. They differ not only in resolution (pixel can have an edge in the order of meters or kilometers) but also in the time range of data and type of variables. For many questions, we can thus obtain relevant data without having to install climate stations. However, it is always necessary to assess whether the given data is suitable for solving the given question, primarily with regard to resolution, but also the data source. In this chapter, we will show several examples of rasters and how to work with them in the R environment. For rasters, it is often simpler to use a geographic information system (GIS), such as QGIS.

## 4.1. Microclimate Rasters for Šumava NP Processed by IBOT

For Šumava National Park, we prepared a set of microclimatic maps covering the territory of Šumava NP and Bavarian Forest NP in 2021. The data is publicly published (Brůna et al., 2023) and can be worked with directly in the R environment. The maps were created using data from a network of microclimatic stations from October 2019 - October 2020. The effect of vegetation cover and topography was incorporated using laser scanning (LiDAR) data. The interpolation models take into account not only topographic influences on microclimate but also the influence of density and type of vegetation cover. The maps are suitable for solving detailed questions concerning climate in forest stands and adjacent open areas at 3 different heights - below ground, 15 cm above ground, and 200 cm above ground.

Preparation of required R environment libraries.

```{r 04_load_library, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# List of required libraries
required_packages <- c("terra", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "viridis", "sf", "easyclimate", "curl", "webshot2", "chromote")

# Installation and loading of libraries
suppressWarnings(
  lapply(required_packages, function(pkg) {
    if (!require(pkg, character.only = TRUE)) install.packages(pkg, repos = "https://mirrors.nic.cz/R/")
    library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
  })
)

# Clean up variables in R environment
rm(required_packages)

# Create folder for downloaded data if it doesn't exist
dir.create("./data/rastry", recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)
```

The following are available in the **Zenodo** repository (filename can be used in the following code):

**Soil temperature (-8 cm)**

- Average temperature = mean temperature *T.soil_8_cm.mean.tif*


**Air temperature at ground level (15 cm)**

- Average temperature *T.air_15_cm.mean.tif*

- Maximum temperature = 95th percentile of daily maximum temperatures *T.air_15_cm.max.95p.tif*

- Minimum temperature = 5th percentile of daily minimum temperatures *T.air_15_cm.min.5p.tif*


**Air temperature (200 cm)**

- Average temperature *T.air_200_cm.mean.tif*

- Maximum temperature = 95th percentile of daily maximum temperatures *T.air_200_cm.max.95p.tif*

- Minimum temperature = 5th percentile of daily minimum temperatures *T.air_200_cm.min.5p.tif*

- GDD = sum of growing degree days above base temperature (base 5°C) *T.air_200_cm.GDD5.tif*


Using the following code, we will download the map of average temperature at 15 cm above ground and load it into the **zeta** object.

```{r 04-get_raster_zenodo, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
# URL for file download (file T.air_15_cm.mean.tif from Zenodo archive, size 97.0 MB)
soubor <- c("T.air_15_cm.mean.tif")

url <- paste0("https://zenodo.org/record/6352641/files/",soubor)

# Path where to save file
destfile <- paste0("./data/rastry/", soubor)

# Create folder if it doesn't exist
dir.create("./data/rastry", recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)

# download raster using curl
curl::multi_download(url, destfile, resume = T)

# Loading raster using terra library
zeta <- terra::rast(destfile)
```

### Map

After downloading, we'll visualize the entire map using a basic plot.

```{r 04_prepare_graph, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Map of annual average air temperature 15 cm above ground in Šumava NP (10-2019 - 10-2020). The map shows a strong influence of elevation on temperature. The influence of topography is also apparent.", fig.width = 5.33, fig.height = 4}
# Setting space for legend
par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 5))  # Adding space on right side for legend
par(oma = c(2, 1, 1, 1))  # Increasing outer bottom margin

# Basic plot of raster using plot() function
plot(zeta, col = viridis::viridis(100), 
     xlab = "Longitude", ylab = "Latitude")

# Adding label to legend with unit (°C)
mtext("Temperature (°C)", side = 4, line = 3)  # Adding label on right side
```

### Histogram

Now let's look at the distribution of temperatures using a histogram, which will show the frequency of different values.

```{r 04_histogram_zeta, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="The histogram shows that the annual average is 6.09°C, but in different areas it can range from 4.4°C to 8.6°C.", fig.width = 5.33, fig.height = 4}
# Calculate average value of raster
values_zeta <- values(zeta)
mean_zeta <- mean(values_zeta, na.rm = TRUE)

# Create histogram for raster values
hist_zeta <- hist(values_zeta, main = "Temperature Histogram", 
                  xlab = "Average Annual Temperature (°C)", ylab = "Frequency",
                  col = "lightblue", breaks = 20, 
                  probability = TRUE, border = "gray")

# Add vertical line indicating average
abline(v = mean_zeta, col = "red", lwd = 2)

# Add label with average value
text(mean_zeta, par("usr")[4] * 0.92,
     labels = paste0("Average: ", round(mean_zeta, 2)," °C"),
     col = "red", pos = 4)
```

### Subset

Now let's look at a smaller area to utilize the high resolution of the maps. For example, we'll crop the map to a 1000 x 1000 m square around Březnická Lodge.

```{r 04-zoom_raster, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Subset: this map shows warmer, south-facing meadow areas below Březnická Lodge (marked with x) and colder valley positions. Again, this is annual average temperature (10-2019 - 10-2020).", fig.width = 5.33, fig.height = 4}
# Define center coordinates in WGS84 (EPSG:4326)
lat <- 48.9712522 # Březnická Lodge
lon <- 13.4825903
coords <- data.frame(lon, lat)

# Create sf object with coordinates in EPSG:4326
point_wgs84 <- st_as_sf(coords, coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326)

# Transform point to coordinate system matching raster data
# (3-degree Gauss-Kruger zone 4, EPSG:31468)
point_epsg31468 <- st_transform(point_wgs84, 31468)

# Get coordinates for creating rectangle (bounding box) around point
point_coords <- st_coordinates(point_epsg31468)
x_center <- point_coords[1, "X"]
y_center <- point_coords[1, "Y"]

# Define subset size (e.g., 500x500 meters around point)
buffer_size <- 500  # half size (in meters)
xmin <- x_center - buffer_size
xmax <- x_center + buffer_size
ymin <- y_center - buffer_size
ymax <- y_center + buffer_size

# Create rectangle (bbox)
bbox <- terra::ext(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)

# Crop raster using rectangle
zeta_cropped <- crop(zeta, bbox)

# Set margins on map edges for legend
par(mar = c(4, 4, 4, 5))  # Add space on right side for legend
par(oma = c(2, 1, 1, 1))  # Increase outer bottom margin

# Basic plot of raster using plot() function
plot(zeta_cropped, col = viridis::viridis(100), 
     xlab = "Longitude (m), EPSG:31468", 
     ylab = "Latitude (m)")

# Add label to legend with unit (°C)
mtext("Temperature (°C)", side = 4, line = 3)  # Add label on right side

# Add point with coordinates on map ('x' symbol)
points(x_center, y_center, pch = 4, col = "red", cex = 1.5)  # pch=4 is 'x' symbol
```

```{r 04_cleanup_1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Clean up unnecessary variables
rm(url,point_epsg31468, bbox, coords, lat, lon, x_center, xmax, 
   xmin, y_center, ymin, ymax, point_coords, buffer_size)
```

### Extracting Values from Rasters for Points

Values in raster form are good for creating maps, but more often we need values for points of interest as input for analysis. The following example first converts points to the map's coordinate system, then extracts values for the points and adds them to the table.

```{r 04_data_for_points, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tab.cap="The last point has NA value in the temperature column, likely because it was outside the map area. We can easily verify this by plotting the points on the map."}
# Loading lat/lon coordinates from CSV that contains 'lat' and 'lon' columns
coords_data <- read.csv("data/rastry/souradnice.csv", sep=";")

# Creating sf object from coordinates in EPSG:4326 (WGS84)
points_wgs84 <- st_as_sf(coords_data, coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326)

# Transforming points to EPSG:31468
points_epsg31468 <- st_transform(points_wgs84, 31468)

# Converting sf object to format suitable for terra::extract
coords_matrix <- st_coordinates(points_epsg31468)

# Extracting values from raster for coordinates using bilinear interpolation
values <- terra::extract(zeta, coords_matrix, method = "bilinear")

# Joining extracted values with coordinates and saving to new table
final_data <- cbind(coords_data, values)
default_kable(final_data)
```

We can also visualize the points directly on the map with the raster. This also helps us verify the correctness of the points.

```{r 04 check_on_map, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,fig.cap="Here we can see that one of the points was indeed outside the map area.", fig.width = 5.33, fig.height = 4}
# Setting space for legend and plot
par(mar = c(4, 4, 4, 5))  # Adding space on right side for legend
par(oma = c(2, 1, 1, 1))  # Increasing outer bottom margin

# Plotting raster - for checking that all points are inside map
plot(zeta, main = "Visualization of raster with coordinates", 
     col = viridis(100),  # Using viridis color scale
     xlab = "Longitude (m), EPSG:31468", 
     ylab = "Latitude (m)")

# Adding legend with unit (°C)
mtext("Temperature (°C)", side = 4, line = 3)

# Adding all points from coordinates as crosses (pch=4 is 'x' symbol)
points(coords_matrix[,1], coords_matrix[,2], pch = 4, col = "red", cex = 1.5)  
```

```{r 04_cleanup_11, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Clean up unnecessary variables
rm(coords_data, points_wgs84, points_epsg31468, coords_matrix, values)
```

## 4.2. External Sources

### ForestClim

Now let's look at the external source ForestClim (Haesen et al., 2023). This is a set of bioclimatological variable maps covering European forests with 25 m resolution. The map set is based on measurements by microclimatic dataloggers, predominantly TOMST TMS-4. Its use therefore targets temperature differences in vegetation stands. The high resolution allows comparison of even very close locations. In this case, bioclimatological variables are available that summarize microclimate using 11 derived variables:

ForestClim_01 = mean annual temperature

ForestClim_02 = mean diurnal temperature range

ForestClim_03 = isothermality

ForestClim_04 = temperature seasonality

ForestClim_05 = maximum temperature of warmest month

ForestClim_06 = minimum temperature of coldest month

ForestClim_07 = annual temperature range

ForestClim_08 = mean temperature of wettest quarter

ForestClim_09 = mean temperature of driest quarter

ForestClim_10 = mean temperature of warmest quarter

ForestClim_11 = mean temperature of coldest quarter

Individual files are around 6 GB in size, so it's easier to download the data beforehand here:
<https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/ForestClim_Bioclimatic_variables_for_microclimate_temperatures_of_European_forests/22059125?file=39164684>

For our example, we'll use mean annual temperature, i.e., layer ForestClim_01. We have saved a subset for the Šumava NP area in the data folder. The following example will again generate a simple map.

```{r 04_forestclim_load, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Visualization of ForestClim_01 raster subset for Šumava NP area", fig.width = 5.33, fig.height = 4}
# Loading ForestClim raster using terra
forest_raster <- terra::rast("./data/rastry/ForestClim_01_CZE_NPS.tif")

# Displaying new raster
par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 5))  # Setting margins
plot(forest_raster, main = paste0("Visualization of raster ", "ForestClim_01"), 
     col = viridis::viridis(100), 
     xlab = "Longitude", ylab = "Latitude")

# Adding label to legend
mtext("Temperature (°C)", side = 4, line = 3)  # Adding label on right side
```

Let's look at the histogram of mean annual temperatures again.

```{r 04_forestclim_histogram, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Although the average is very similar, the counts of values in this raster are different."}
# Histogram for ForestClim raster
forest_mean_value <- mean(values(forest_raster), na.rm = TRUE)

# Histogram for ForestClim
hist_forest <- hist(values(forest_raster), main = "ForestClim Histogram", 
                    xlab = "Mean Annual Temperature (°C)", ylab = "Count",
                    col = "lightgreen", breaks = 20, 
                    probability = TRUE, border = "gray")

# Adding vertical line indicating average for ForestClim raster
abline(v = forest_mean_value, col = "darkred", lwd = 2)

# Adding label for mean value
text(forest_mean_value, par("usr")[4] * 0.9, labels = 
     paste0("Mean: ", round(forest_mean_value, 2),"°C"), 
     col = "darkred", pos = 4)
```

And again let's look at the detail of the map around Březnická Lodge

```{r 04_zoom_forestclim, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Here we can see a weakness of this dataset. Besides lower spatial resolution (larger pixels), it's the coverage of only forest stands, which are defined by Copernicus layers (more in Haesen et al., 2023), and thus disturbed areas, regeneration, and lower stands are not included.", fig.width = 5.33, fig.height = 4}
# Using same point_wgs84, defined in previous example (Březnická Lodge)
# Transform point to EPSG:3035 (European Lambert Conformal Conic)
point_epsg3035 <- st_transform(point_wgs84, 3035)

# Get coordinates for creating rectangle (bounding box) around point
point_coords <- st_coordinates(point_epsg3035)
x_center <- point_coords[1, "X"]
y_center <- point_coords[1, "Y"]

# Define subset size (e.g., 500 meters around point)
buffer_size <- 500  
xmin <- x_center - buffer_size
xmax <- x_center + buffer_size
ymin <- y_center - buffer_size
ymax <- y_center + buffer_size

# Create rectangle (bbox)
bbox <- terra::ext(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)

# Crop raster using rectangle (for ForestClim raster)
forest_raster_cropped <- crop(forest_raster, bbox)

# Setting space for legend
par(mar = c(4, 4, 4, 5))  # Adding space on right side for legend
par(oma = c(2, 1, 1, 1))  # Increasing outer bottom margin

# Basic plot of raster using plot() function
plot(forest_raster_cropped, main = paste0("Visualization of ForestClim raster subset"),
     col = viridis::viridis(100),
     xlab = "Longitude (m), EPSG:3035", 
     ylab = "Latitude (m)")

# Adding label to legend
mtext("Raster values", side = 4, line = 3)  # Label on right side

# Adding point with coordinates on map ('x' symbol)
points(x_center, y_center, pch = 4, col = "red", cex = 1.5)  # pch=4 is 'x' symbol
```

### Comparison of Histograms between ForestClim and IBOT Rasters

It makes sense to compare with the average temperature raster created by the Institute of Botany. This part relies on variables that you created when running the code in section 4.1.

```{r 04_compare, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Although the average of both datasets doesn't differ much, the histogram shows that the microclimatic map processed by the Institute of Botany has more colder values than average and also locations with higher temperatures. Both probably relate to ForestClim's forest-only crop, however, it may also indicate a greater influence of stands on microclimate in the dataset created by the Institute of Botany."}
# Values for both rasters
values_forest <- values(forest_raster)

# Calculation of common histogram breaks
breaks <- seq(min(c(values_zeta, values_forest), na.rm = TRUE), 
              max(c(values_zeta, values_forest), na.rm = TRUE), length.out = 30)

# Plotting first histogram for T.air_15_cm.mean.tif (in memory from previous calculations)
plot(hist_zeta, col = rgb(0, 0, 1, 0.5), xlim = range(breaks), 
     ylim = c(0, max(hist_zeta$counts)), 
     main = "Combined histogram of rasters with dual Y axis", 
     xlab = "Value", ylab = soubor, 
     cex.main = 1.2)  # Reducing title size

# Adding line and label for T.air_15_cm.mean.tif mean (average above line)
abline(v = mean_zeta, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
text(mean_zeta, max(hist_zeta$counts) * 0.75, labels = 
       paste0("Mean: ", round(mean_zeta, 2),"°C"), col = "blue", pos = 4)

# Plotting second y axis on right side
par(new = TRUE)
plot(hist_forest, col = rgb(0, 1, 0, 0.5), xlim = range(breaks), 
     ylim = c(0, max(hist_forest$counts)), 
     axes = FALSE, xlab = "", ylab = "", main="")
axis(side = 4)
mtext("ForestClim Frequency", side = 4, line = 3)

# Adding line and label for ForestClim mean (average below line)
abline(v = forest_mean_value, col = "darkgreen", lwd = 2)
text(forest_mean_value, max(hist_forest$counts) * 0.5, labels = 
       paste0("Mean: ", round(forest_mean_value, 2),"°C"), col = "darkgreen", pos = 4)

# Adding legend
legend("topright", legend = c("T.air_15_cm.mean", "ForestClim 01"), 
       fill = c(rgb(0, 0, 1, 0.5), rgb(0, 1, 0, 0.5)))
```

```{r 04_forestclim_cleanup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Delete downloaded file
unlink(destfile)
# Clean up unnecessary variables
rm(hist_zeta, hist_forest, zeta, zeta_cropped, values_zeta, values_forest,

   forest_raster_cropped, point_coords, point_epsg3035, point_wgs84,
   buffer_size, destfile, soubor, x_center, xmax, xmin, y_center, ymax, ymin)

### Downscaled E-OBS Data Using the *easyclimate* Library

The easyclimate library provides access to daily climate data with 1 km resolution for Europe (precipitation, minimum and maximum temperatures) from the European climate database hosted at the [University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria](https://boku.ac.at/en/wabo/waldbau/wir-ueber-uns/daten). Data is currently available from 1950 to 2022.

The input climate dataset is based on downscaled E-OBS (European Observations) rasters. It was originally created by [A. Moreno and H. Hasenauer - https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.4436](https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.4436) and further developed by W. Rammer, C. Pucher and M. Neumann. The current version is v4 - detailed description in [this document - https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22962671.v1](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22962671.v1)). For a detailed description of the easyclimate library, read [this article - https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2023.105627](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2023.105627) (open access version <https://doi.org/10.32942/osf.io/mc8uj>) or visit the [library website - https://verughub.github.io/easyclimate/](https://verughub.github.io/easyclimate/).

The input E-OBS rasters are based on interpolation of data from 7,852 climate stations in Europe. Thanks to this, they are suitable for characterizing macroclimate regardless of forest influence or other landscape cover. Through downscaling, the resolution was increased to 1 km, which still cannot capture microclimatic differences.

```{r 04_EOBS_load_library, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# List of required libraries
required_packages <- c("terra", "ggplot2", "easyclimate", "tidyterra", 
                       "raster", "leaflet", "dplyr", "webshot2", "htmlwidgets")

# Installation and loading of libraries

  })
)
# Clean up variables in R environment
rm(required_packages)
```

Example of downloading a raster for a selected area. The advantage is that we can download multiple days at once. We'll load the Šumava NP boundary in UTM 33N coordinate system, convert it to the data source coordinate system (WGS 84) and download data for May 1-3, 2020.

```{r 04_EOBS_load_nps, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
## Loading shapefile from specified path (EPSG:32633)
nps_region <- vect("./data/rastry/NPS_UTM33N.shp")

## Converting shapefile to required coordinate system (EPSG:4326 for lon lat coordinates)
nps_region <- project(nps_region, "EPSG:4326")

## Downloading Tmax values for Šumava NP area between May 1-3, 2020
nps_temp <- get_daily_climate(
  coords = nps_region,
  climatic_var = "Tmax", # can be changed to "Prcp" for precipitation or "Tmin" for min temperatures
  # mean temperature is not available here, but is commonly calculated as (Tmax+Tmin)/2
  period = "2020-05-01:2020-05-03",
  output = "raster"
)
```

The output **nps_temp** is a SpatRaster object with 3 layers (for each of the 3 days). Now let's display maps for individual days.

```{r 04_EOBS_plot_nps, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide', fig.cap="The three maps show maximum temperatures for individual days May 1-3, 2020.", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 2}
# Plotting individual layers and adding nps_region polygon boundaries
ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = nps_temp) +
  facet_wrap(~lyr, ncol = 3) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "RdYlBu", na.value = "transparent") +
  geom_spatvector(data = nps_region, fill = NA) +
  labs(fill = "Maximum\ntemperature \n(ºC)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(13.3, 13.9, by = 0.3)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(48.8, 49.2, by = 0.2)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Since data is available from 1950, we can use it well for comparison.

```{r 04_EOBS_load_1950, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide', fig.cap="The three maps show maximum temperatures for individual days May 1-3, 1950. The legend has a different range of values.", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 2}
## Downloading Tmax values for NPS area between May 1-3, 1950
nps_temp_1950 <- get_daily_climate(
  coords = nps_region,
  climatic_var = "Tmax",
  period = "1950-05-01:1950-05-03",
  output = "raster"
)

# Plotting individual layers (days) and adding nps_region polygon boundaries
ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = nps_temp_1950) +
  facet_wrap(~lyr, ncol = 3) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "RdYlBu", na.value = "transparent") +
  geom_spatvector(data = nps_region, fill = NA) +
  labs(fill = "Maximum\ntemperature \n(ºC)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(13.3, 13.9, by = 0.3)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(48.8, 49.2, by = 0.2)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Now we can calculate the difference for individual days between 2020 and 1950 and display in maps again. Daily temperature heterogeneity is high, so in analyses it's usually better to aggregate data over longer time periods - months, seasons, or years and compare those between each other.

```{r 04_EOBS_2020_1950_difference, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Differences between rasters between 2020 and 1950 were very different in individual days. When comparing individual days, it's mainly about specific weather and it's difficult to infer the influence of climate change.", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 2}
# Calculate difference between temperatures (nps_temp - nps_temp_1950)
nps_temp_diff <- nps_temp - nps_temp_1950

ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = nps_temp_diff) +
  facet_wrap(~lyr, ncol = 3) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "RdYlBu", na.value = "transparent") +
  geom_spatvector(data = nps_region, fill = NA) +
  labs(fill = "Difference \nmaximum \ntemperature \n2020-1950 \n(ºC)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(13.3, 13.9, by = 0.3)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(48.8, 49.2, by = 0.2)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Interactive Map Output

The following example demonstrates how to visualize a map in an interactive environment with a base map. This can be useful if you want to show results to someone who doesn't use R or GIS but wants to explore the data more than just from images.

```{r 04_EOBS_leaflet, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Interactive map uses online base map. However, the main advantage is the ability to easily manipulate the map, which cannot be shown in PDF format."}
if (is_html_output || is_interactive) { # Code for HTML version or interactive mode
  nps_temp_diff_1 <- nps_temp_diff[[1]]  # Select layer as needed
  nps_temp_diff_1_raster <- as(nps_temp_diff_1, "Raster")
  raster_values <- raster::values(nps_temp_diff_1_raster)
  
  # Color palette for visualization
  pal <- colorNumeric(palette = "RdYlBu", domain = raster_values, 
                      na.color = "transparent")
  
  # Creating interactive map
  leaflet() %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addRasterImage(nps_temp_diff_1_raster, colors = pal, opacity = 0.8) %>%
    addPolygons(data = as(nps_region, "Spatial"), fill = NA, color = "black") %>%
    addLegend(pal = pal, values = raster_values, title = "Difference Tmax 2020-1950 (ºC)")
  
} else { # Code for non-HTML version (PDF/Word - static image)
  nps_temp_diff_1 <- nps_temp_diff[[1]]  # Select layer as needed
  nps_temp_diff_1_raster <- as(nps_temp_diff_1, "Raster")
  raster_values <- raster::values(nps_temp_diff_1_raster)
  
  # Color palette
  pal <- colorNumeric(palette = "RdYlBu", domain = raster_values, 
                      na.color = "transparent")
  
  # Creating interactive map that we'll save as HTML
  map <- leaflet() %>%
    addTiles() %>%
    addRasterImage(nps_temp_diff_1_raster, colors = pal, opacity = 0.8) %>%
    addPolygons(data = as(nps_region, "Spatial"), fill = NA, color = "black") %>%
    addLegend(pal = pal, values = raster_values, title = "Difference Tmax 2020-1950 (ºC)")
  
  # Saving widget as HTML file
  htmlwidgets::saveWidget(map, "./images/map.html", selfcontained = TRUE)
  
  # Creating static snapshot of map using webshot
  #webshot("./images/map.html", file = "./images/map.png", cliprect = "viewport")
  webshot2::webshot("./images/map.html", file = "./images/map.png", cliprect = "viewport", 
                   vwidth = 1000, vheight = 800, delay = 5)

  
  # Inserting image into document
  knitr::include_graphics("./images/map.png", dpi=150)
}
```

## 4.3. Microclimate Rasters for České Švýcarsko National Park Processed by IBOT

Similar to Šumava NP, a microclimatic atlas was also created for České Švýcarsko NP and Saxon Switzerland NP. Using the following code, you can again download a selected map and visualize it using a map in the R environment.

<https://gitlab.ibot.cas.cz/matej.man/microclimate-atlas-public/>

In this case, layers are available for years 2018-2020, with year 2018 corresponding to the period November 2018 - October 2019. Unlike the microclimatic rasters of Šumava NP, non-forest areas in České Švýcarsko NP were cut out.

The following variables are available:

- 2018_FDD_baseT0_air_200cm_epsg32633.tif

- 2018_GDD_baseT5_air_200cm_epsg32633.tif

- 2018_T_max95p_air_15cm_epsg32633.tif

- 2018_T_max95p_air_200cm_epsg32633.tif

- 2018_T_mean_air_15cm_epsg32633.tif

- 2018_T_mean_air_200cm_epsg32633.tif

- 2018_T_mean_soil_8cm_epsg32633.tif

- 2018_T_min5p_air_200cm_epsg32633.tif

- 2018_snow_sum_epsg32633.tif

(for other years, only the beginning of the name changes)

```{r 04_npcs_load, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
# URL for file download (file T.air_200_cm.mean.tif from Zenodo)
soubor<-"2020_T_mean_air_15cm_epsg32633.tif"
url <- paste0("https://gitlab.ibot.cas.cz/",
              "matej.man/microclimate-atlas-public/-/",
              "raw/main/geodata/EPSG32633/",soubor)

# Path where to save file
destfile <- paste0("./data/rastry/", soubor)

# Create folder if it doesn't exist
dir.create("./data/rastry", recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)

# Download file if it doesn't exist
if (!file.exists(destfile)) {
  download.file(url, destfile, mode = "wb")
}

# Loading raster using terra library
npcs <- terra::rast(destfile)
```

### Map

Let's look at a map of one layer again. Once we have the map loaded as a raster, all subsequent steps are the same as in chapter 4.1.

```{r 04_NPCS_prepare_plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=" Simple map shows average temperature for the period November 2020 - October 2021.", fig.width = 5.33, fig.height = 4}
# Setting space for legend
par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 5))  # Adding space on right side for legend
par(oma = c(2, 1, 1, 1))  # Increasing outer bottom margin

# Basic plot of raster using plot() function
plot(npcs, col = viridis::viridis(100), 
     xlab = "Longitude", ylab = "Latitude")

# Adding label to legend with unit (°C)
mtext("Temperature (°C)", side = 4, line = 3)  # Adding label on right side
```

```{r 04_npcs_cleanup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Delete downloaded file
unlink(destfile)
# Clean up unnecessary variables
rm(url, npcs, soubor, destfile)
```
